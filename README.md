## This is a code base written for one of my PhD projects - the idea was train a discriminator model (see ```train.py```) that could categorise improvised phrases on the fly according to whatever `mode' of improvising they belong to, and then interact with the trained model (see ```interact.py```). 

### The resulting piece can heard/seen here: https://youtu.be/Nin8GIIZW-4?si=k2_Aq2CS34_O3i6L&t=857

### The code ended being very specific to what I was trying to do at the time, but there's plenty that should be useful to others and the codebase is reasonably well-organised.
